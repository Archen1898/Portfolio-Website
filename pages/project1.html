        <p class="textElement">&emsp;The Waste Recognition System is an automated recycling bin that is capable of separating bottles from regular waste.</p>
        <h2 class="titleElement">My Role on the Team</h2>
        <p>&emsp;I was responsible for designing and implementing the image recognition functionality of the project using a Raspberry Pi unit. I utilized an open source image recognition software called OpenCV and installed it via the command line onto the Raspberry Pi. Once I got the basic object recognition functionality up and running I was able to redesign the code to suite our project's needs. Once completed, I integrated the motor controls with the image recognition software then refactored the code to decrease the system's response delay by about 40%. </p>
        <h2 class="titleElement">Demonstration</h2>
          <video class = "videoElement" src = "../media/videos/Demonstration.mp4" poster="../media/images/Team Picture.PNG" controls ></video>
            
          <p class="textElement"> &emsp;This is a demonstration video created by my senior design team. In the video, my team member, Alejandro Aloma demonstrates the functionality of our Waste Recognition System. The System utilizes image recognition to analyse captured frames from a camera inside the System. From there, it compares each object inserted into the trash chute and determines whether or not it is a bottle. If it is a bottle, it moves the object to the recycling bin and if not, it sends it to the regular trash bin. Each bin also has an ultrasonic sensor attached to determine its fullness. Once the height of the trash within each bin reaches a predetermined level, the LED light lights up to indicated that the bin is full.</p>

          <h2 class="titleElement">Proof of Concept</h2>
          <video controls class="videoElement" src="../media/videos/Proof of Concept Video.mp4"></video>
        <p>&emsp;The Proof of Concept video follows the team's design decisions with regard to the Waste Recognition System. We dicuss how we chose between three concepts that were developed by the team,</p>
